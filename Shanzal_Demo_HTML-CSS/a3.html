          <br>The Indian locomotive class WAG-12B is a class of 25 kV AC electric locomotives that was developed in 2017
          by Alstom with technological collaboration with Indian Railways.
          <br>The model name stands for broad gauge (W), Alternating Current (AC), Goods traffic (G) locomotive, 12000
          hp (12).
          <br>They entered trial service in 2019. A total of 230 WAG-12B have been built at Electric Locomotive Factory,
          Madhepura, Bihar, India.
          <br>With a power output of 12,000 HP, the WAG 12 is twice as powerful as its immediate predecessor, WAG-9, and
          is among the most powerful freight locomotives in the world.
          <br>The locomotive is being developed for deployment on the Dedicated Freight Corridors, where it will be used
          to haul freight trains weighing more
          <br>than 6,000 tonnes (5,900 long tons; 6,600 short tons) at speeds of 100 km/h (62 mph) to 120 km/h (75 mph),
          essentially doubling the average speed of freight trains in the sector.
