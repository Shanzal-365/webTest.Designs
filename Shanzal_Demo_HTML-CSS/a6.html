          <br>The Indian locomotive class WAP-5 is the name of a class of "High Speed" electric locomotives produced and
          used by Indian Railways.
          <br>The first 10 locomotives were imported from ABB in Switzerland in 1995. They are supposed to be a variant
          of the Swiss Lok 2000 (Design concept)
          <br>and German DB Class 120 (mechanical chassis).
          <br>One of the notable features of WAP-5 is regenerative braking.
          <br>Other notable features of this loco are the provision of taps from the main loco transformer for hotel
          load, pantry loads, flexible gear coupling, wheel-mounted disc brakes, and a potential
          <br>for speed enhancement to 200 km/h (120 mph). Braking systems include 160 kN (36,000 lbf) regenerative
          brakes, loco disc brakes, automatic train air brakes, and a charged spring parking brake.
          <br>On 3 July 2014, a WAP-5 set an Indian speed record by hauling a train from Delhi to Agra within 90 minutes
          at a speed of 160 km/h (99 mph).
          <br>The Gatimaan Express and Bhopal Shatabdi trains hauled by WAP-5 locomotives travel at 160 km/h (99 mph)
          and 150 km/h (93 mph) respectively in the New Delhi - Agra Cantt section.
