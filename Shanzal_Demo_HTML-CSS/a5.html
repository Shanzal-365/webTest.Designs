          <br>The Indian locomotive class WDAP-5 is a class of diesel-electric dual mode locomotive that was developed
          in 2019 by Banaras Locomotive Works (BLW), Varanasi for Indian Railways.
          <br>The model name stands for broad gauge (W), Diesel (D), AC Current (A), Passenger (P) and 5000 Horsepower
          (5).
          <br>The locomotive can deliver 6120 hp in electric mode and 4500 hp in diesel mode. This loco is under trials
          and the Second unit of this series might roll out only in 2022.

          <br>Need for dual mode locomotive
          <br>Since 2016, Indian Railways has pushed for greater electrification of the railway network.[2] In this
          interest, the government, in 2019, approved plans for 100% electrification.
          <br>So far Indian Railways has electrified 52,247 Route kilometers (RKM) that is about 80% of the total broad
          gauge network of Indian Railways (65,414 RKM, including Konkan Railway) by 31 March 2022.
          <br>Using electric locomotives allows the railways to save time by giving a faster acceleration and also saves
          fuel costs. However, these advantages are offset under certain circumstances where the route of the train is
          partly electrified.
          <br>In such cases, trains used to run with a diesel locomotive in non-electrified sections and would be
          switched with an electric locomotive as soon as they enter an electrified section. Instead of the benefits of
          electrification,
          <br>Railways observed a loss of punctuality in such trains due to valuable time being lost to switch between
          diesel and electric locomotives.
          <br>To counter this, in August 2019, Railways issued a circular, asking all zones to haul trains with a diesel
          locomotive if their route was not completely electrified.
          <br>This meant that electrification of railway lines, unless completed end-to-end, did not provide any
          advantage. This problem had been identified by the Railways, way back in 2016, which is when RDSO was
          requested to study the
          <br>feasibility of dual-mode locomotives as a stop-gap until 100% electrification was achieved.
          <br>
          <br>From 2019 till present (July, 2022), Indian Railways have only produced ONE unit of this WDAP-5
          Locomotive,
          <br>because it is in a testing stage.
